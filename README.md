### I build interactive web experiences for brands who are passionate about their vision and ambitious about their impact.

I specialize in working with brands in entertainment, fashion and lifestyle.

I am currently looking for opportunities to build complete web experiences (strategy, design, technology) or front-end/creative development roles with brands and agencies.

My ideal projects include interactive microsites and complete website builds.

Brands I've collaborated with: Spotify, Nike, Converse, Roc Nation, Goldenvoice, Eminem, Alicia Keys, Maroon 5, Pearl Jam, 4Hunnid, Beatport, Ultra Music, Rap Radar, Odesza, Tiesto.
